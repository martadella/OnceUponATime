# OnceUponATime
WordPress plugin for showing future and past events.

Description
------------
Once Upon A Time is a simple WordPress plugin which shows future and/or past events. You can add a new event in your WP admin panel in the "Events" section. To show the events on the front-end, use shortcodes:
* \[once_upon_a_time_upcoming_events title="Upcoming events"] for future events. Set "title" to whatever you want - it will become the header for the upcoming events section.
* \[once_upon_a_time_past_events title="Past events"] for past events. Set "title" to whatever you want - it will become the header for the past events section.

For this plugin to work correctly, you have to make sure to set the correct time zone in the WP admin panel.


Installation
------------
Download the .zip file and import it to the "Plugins" section in your WP admin.
